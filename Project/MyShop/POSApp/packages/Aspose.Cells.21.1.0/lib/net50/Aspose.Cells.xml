            It will be called at the beginning of saving a row and its cells data.
            If current row has some custom properties such as height, style, ...etc.,
            implementation should set those properties to given Row object here.

      <param name="row">
            Row object for implementation to fill data. Its row index is the returned value of latest call of <see cref="M:Aspose.Cells.LightCellsDataProvider.NextRow" />.
            If the row has been initialized in the inner cells model, the existing row object will be used.
            Otherwise a temporary Row object will be used for implementation to fill data.

    <member name="M:Aspose.Cells.LightCellsDataProvider.IsGatherString">
      <summary>
            Checks whether the current string value of cell needs to be gathered into a global pool.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
            Gathering string values will take advantage only when there are many duplicated string values for the cells provided by this implementation.
            In this situation gathering string will save much memory and generate smaller resultant file.
            If there are many string values for the cells provided by LightCellsDataProvider but few of them are same,
            gathering string will cost more memory and time and has no advantage for the resultant file.
            </remarks>
      <returns>
            true if string value need to be gathered into a global pool for the resultant file.
